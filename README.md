# Dude? Where's my Code!
Join me in the Great Refresh! No? Hopefully my programming is better than my Creative Writing. ðŸš€ðŸ’»

## Seriously, where are your projects located?

I recently made the decision to refresh my GitHub profile by deleting all my projects. I wasn't satisfied with the quality of my previous work and felt the need for a fresh start. Taking some personal time off allowed me to reflect, and I'm now excited about building new and improved projects that better showcase my skills and passion. P.S. That's not me in my profile picture â€“ just channeling my inner anime protagonist. Stay tuned for exciting updates!


## What kind of projects should we expect to see?

Curious about the projects you'll find here? Many are still in the planning phase as I ponder questions like, "Do I see myself finishing this?", "Do I have the time?", and "Am I being too ambitious?" While they may not reach the scale of Facebook or X, my commitment is to create quality projects, big or small. Expect anything! Whatever I publish, I'll take pride in, and at the end of the day, that's all that matters...I think ðŸ˜‚.

## Stay Connected?

I'm not rocking a massive Twitter following, just starting fresh with a new account. If you'd like to connect, feel free to follow me <a href="https://twitter.com/malachhhh_maybe" target="_blank">here</a>. I'll be sharing updates and, of course, some carefully planned tweets. See you there! ðŸ˜„
